I've been scouring the web for some icons and these are the best sites I found for SVGs ([which you can turn into XAML paths](http://liftcodeplay.com/2015/09/14/converting-vectorsvg-images-into-xaml/)).

#### Foreword - Segoe MDL2

If possible, consider using the Segue MDL2 font. It has plenty of great icons which scale beautifully. [Here is a cheatsheet](http://modernicons.io/segoe-mdl2/cheatsheet/), though I don't find it exhaustive so make sure to check our character map.

#### Sites

The following are my favourite sites

[https://materialdesignicons.com/](https://materialdesignicons.com/)

[http://modernuiicons.com/](http://modernuiicons.com/)

[http://www.entypo.com/](http://www.entypo.com/)

[https://thenounproject.com/](https://thenounproject.com/)

I would also recommend you checkout this package. It has many of the icons from Entypo and Modern UI already setup as XAML paths
