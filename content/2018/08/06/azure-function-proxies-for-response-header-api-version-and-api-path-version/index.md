In my Azure Function project I had two problems:

1. I wanted my Azure Functions to have a path with **v1** in it
2. I wanted to always return a response header with a version identifier

Here's how I solved.

## Response Header Version Info

Let's say you want to return an API version in the response header. The response header could be something like this below.

If we were using ASP.NET Core we could write a piece of middleware to return this. With Azure Functions we don't have this full framework goodness but we do have a useful tool: Proxies.

You can edit the proxies via the web UI or locally, if you have a local project. If it's the latter you need a proxies.json file at the root of your project.

The key piece is line 10. What we're doing is setting a response override. In other words: always return this. In my case I choose to return a date. You can enter whatever you like.

## Version Number in Path

By default Azure Functions will give you a URL line this:

**https://<your name>.azurewebsites.net/api/<your endpoint>**

I wanted it to have a version number in the path. I want something like this:

**https://<your name>.azurewebsites.net/api/v1/<your endpoint>**

To do this, I need to two things:

1. Define a route. You can see it in line 6. What this is saying itÂ "anything ending with /api/v1/" send it to the path at line 8. The value **{\*restOfPath}** is a variable
2. Line 8 has the destination. I'm saying: "take whatever was after v1 and put it here.

Note how I am using `https://localhost`. Using this means I can avoid a round trip to my destination URL.

Voila - all done!
