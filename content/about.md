Kia Ora! I’m Ben Chartrand, a software developer living in Wellington, New Zealand.

My passions are software development, history, science and learning in general. I’m particularly excited by all the advancements in serverless technology.

What pushed me over the edge to finally setup a blog was Scott Hanselman’s [ThinkPad ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_KtIHEGrmc) and a [blog post encouraging people to blog](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/YourBlogIsTheEngineOfCommunity.aspx). I’ve been a consumer of many a blog, often answering some vital question I couldn’t find elsewhere. As Scott mentioned said in his video, I’m keen to document some knowledge – to contribute – and be a producer/creator of content.
